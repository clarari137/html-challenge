## Sources
I used the following sources for support with this challenge:
- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html to convert my terrestrial_date column to datetime
- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.astype.html for help changing the datatypes
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65311823/getting-error-keyerror-only-the-series-name-can-be-used-for-the-key-in-series for help debugging and dropping the empty columns that were included in my scraping attempt. 

I also walked through some code with Danielle Dubash from my class and she helped me add "for i in range(0,7):" to my for loop so that I could scrape the table data into my list.
